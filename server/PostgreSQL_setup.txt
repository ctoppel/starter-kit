Open terminal and write following commands:

createdb [database name]
psql postgres / [database name]
create user [username];
alter user [username] with password '123456’;
grant all privileges on database [database] to [username];

———-

Use GUI(pgAdmin(local), elephantSQL(online)) or CLI(from root with sql running): psql -d [database] -U [username]

Use query to insert rows into database(use single quotes and remember that in columns reserved words and camelCase words must be put into quotes):

INSERT INTO [tableName]([col1], [col2], ...) VALUES('[val1]', '[val2]');

————

Put pgConnection.js file into server folder in project:

const Sequelize = require('sequelize');

const connection = new Sequelize('postgres://[username]:[password]@[url]:5432/[database]’);

module.exports = connection;

————

Create models folder in server folder and place models(schemas) to create columns to be used in a table — see example in models folder

————

Create controllers in controllers folder in server folder and place middlewares to read and write data (create rows and access them) — see example in controllers folder
